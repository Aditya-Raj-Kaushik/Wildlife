# üêæ Wildlife Animal Detection and Localization

This project detects and localizes wild animals in videos captured at a wildlife sanctuary using object detection models like YOLOv5/YOLOv8. It helps automate wildlife monitoring by drawing bounding boxes around detected animals and identifying their species.

## üì∏ Project Objective
- Automatically detect wild animals in video footage.
- Localize animals using bounding boxes.
- Classify animal species.
- Optionally log timestamps and species count.
